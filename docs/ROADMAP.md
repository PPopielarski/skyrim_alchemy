ToDo: 

1. Change GUI from Tkinter to PySide6.
2. Add ability to remember settings, e.g. pinned table items, counts of ingredients or previously selected translation.
3. Add translations and translation engine.

Future:
- Add vendors and location of ingredients. Vendors with prices, locations with details 
(what creature should be killed and so on).
- Add functionality of finding the cheapest/fastest/easiest way to create particular potion.
