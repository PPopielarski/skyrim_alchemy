ToDo: 

1. Change data storage to JSON file. Reason: better maintenance and more flexible development.

2. Add documentation in Mermaid.

3. Change GUI from Tkinter to PySide6.

4. Add vendors and location of ingredients. Vendors with prices, locations with details 
(what creature should be killed and so on).

5. Add functionality of finding the cheapest/fastest/easiest way to create particular potion.

6. Add translations and translation engine.
